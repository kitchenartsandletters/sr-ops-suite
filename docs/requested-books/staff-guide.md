Requested Books — Staff Guide

How to Track Customer Requests in Slack

This guide explains how to use the #requested-books Slack channel so that customer requests don’t get lost, duplicated, or accidentally re-worked.

You do not need to learn a new system.
You only need to be clear and consistent when updating a request.

⸻

What this channel is (and is not)

This channel is
	•	A shared log of customer book requests
	•	A place to record status updates that others can see
	•	A reference point for follow-ups

This channel is not
	•	A private to-do list
	•	A place where silence means “done”
	•	A system that automatically knows what happened

If it isn’t written in the thread, the system does not know it happened.

⸻

The lifecycle of a request (simple version)

Every request moves through these stages:
	1.	Requested – Customer asked for a book
	2.	Acknowledged – A staff member replied
	3.	Ordered – The book was ordered
	4.	Notified – The customer was contacted
	5.	Fulfilled – The request is complete
	6.	Cancelled – The request will not be fulfilled

You do not need to mark every stage — only the important ones.

How the system understands requests

The system reads only what is written in Slack.
It does not guess.

Here’s how it interprets things:

⸻

1. Requested

What this looks like
	•	A message is posted in #requested-books
	•	No replies yet

What it means
	•	A customer has asked for a book
	•	No visible staff action yet

What you should do
	•	Nothing yet — this is just the starting point

⸻

2. Acknowledged

What this looks like
	•	Any reply to the request

Examples
	•	“Checking availability”
	•	“Looking into this”
	•	“Will follow up”
    •	“Added to IG Cart”

What it means
	•	Someone has seen and touched the request
	•	It does not mean the book was ordered

Why this matters
	•	It tells others the request hasn’t been forgotten

⸻

3. Ordered (important!)

What this looks like
	•	A reply that explicitly says the book was ordered

Recommended wording
	•	Ordered
	•	On order
	•	Placed order with distributor

What it means
	•	The book has been ordered
	•	It has not necessarily arrived yet

⚠️ Important
	•	If you don’t say “ordered,” the system will not assume it was ordered
	•	Silence ≠ ordered

⸻

4. Notified (very important)

What this looks like
	•	A reply that includes the word “notified”

Recommended wording
	•	Notified 3/12
	•	Customer notified
	•	Notified via email

What it means
	•	The customer has been contacted
	•	The request is now waiting on the customer

Important clarification
	•	Notified does NOT mean fulfilled
	•	Many requests stop here until pickup or follow-up

⸻

5. Fulfilled (this must be explicit)

What this looks like
	•	A reply clearly stating completion

Recommended wording
	•	Fulfilled
	•	Picked up
	•	Completed

(Optionally: add a ✅ checkmark to the original message)

What it means
	•	The request is done
	•	No further action needed

⚠️ Critical rule

If fulfillment is not marked, the system treats the request as still open.

This prevents requests from being accidentally reopened or re-worked.

⸻

6. Cancelled

What this looks like
	•	A reply saying:
	•	Cancelled
	•	Customer cancelled

What it means
	•	The request should not be pursued further

⸻

What NOT to do (very important)

Please avoid the following:
	•	 Do not rely on emojis alone to close a request
	•	 Do not assume others know a book was ordered
	•	 Do not leave a request silent after fulfillment
	•	 Do not edit the original request to update status

Why?
Because replies are how the system and other staff see progress.

⸻

Why this matters

Being explicit helps:
	•	Prevent duplicate orders
	•	Prevent missed follow-ups
	•	Make handoffs between staff clear
	•	Ensure customers aren’t contacted multiple times
	•	Keep reports accurate

This is about clarity, not extra work.

⸻

Quick reference (TL;DR)

When something happens, add a reply:

Situation	What to reply
You’ve looked at it	Any reply
You placed an order	Ordered
You contacted the customer	Notified
Customer picked up / done	Fulfilled
Request won’t proceed	Cancelled


⸻

Final reminder

Slack is the record.

If it’s not written in the thread, it didn’t happen as far as the system knows.

Thank you for helping keep requests clear and customers happy.
