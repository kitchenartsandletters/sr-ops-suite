📌 Requested Books — Quick Guide

What this channel is
A shared log of customer book requests that are not yet Shopify orders and must be tracked manually in Slack.

⸻

Core Rule

Replies are the record.
If it isn’t written in the thread, the system does not know it happened.

⸻

How to use the channel
	•	Post one request per customer/book
	•	Always reply in the original thread
	•	Replies are additive — don’t edit or overwrite history

⸻

Request lifecycle (conceptual)

Requested → Acknowledged → Ordered → Notified → Fulfilled / Cancelled

You don’t need to comment on every step — but any meaningful action must be recorded.

⸻

What to reply (use these words)
	•	Looked at it → any reply
	•	Placed an order → Ordered
	•	Contacted customer → Notified
	•	Request completed → Fulfilled / Picked up
	•	Request won’t proceed → Cancelled

Be explicit. Silence ≠ action.

⸻

Do not
	•	Post updates outside the thread
	•	Assume others know what happened
	•	Rely on emojis alone
	•	Leave fulfilled requests unmarked

⸻

Final rule
If it’s not written in the thread, the system does not know it happened.

This version is intentionally blunt, scannable, and low-friction.
